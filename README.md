Rokkit Tanx
===========

So, I made this game for [Operation Catapult 2008](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/catapult/) along with my group. It is totes awesome and amazing. It is githubbed for posterity. The original authors are

* Steven Ruppert (me)
* Reyer Swengel
* Mike Brassfield
* Leah Cocco

How to Play
-----------

Rokkit Tanx requires [pygame](http://pygame.org/) to run. Once you have that installed where python can see it, run RokkitTanx.py.

Use the arrow keys to move around. Hold 'up' at the beginning of the game to avoid dying. Once the platforms appear, bounce on them to continue upwards, until you no longer can. Fun times!
